Group owners can edit the groups they own or leave the groups they are apart of. Finally create a transaction and select the group you wish the transaction to be linked to and how much each group members owes, default is 0. Users part of the transaction group can then see the transaction and set is as payed when they have payed the transaction owner.",

So when they invest in stock x, our tools proportionally invest for you in the same stock. When they pull out of stock y, your bot will pull out of that stock too!
